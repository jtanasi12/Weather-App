 *
 * This package contains implementation 
 * of the Iterator design pattern with 
 * a concrete class - LinkList that contains
 * nested classes. One inner class - LinkedListIterator
 * and one static inner class - Node.
 * 
 * The LinkList uses generic code so that any number of structures
 * that support List interface can return a way to iterate through
 * them without clients having access to the internals.
