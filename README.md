# Weather-App

Collaborating within a team of four adept software engineers, we conceived and crafted a robust back-end weather server for a dynamic classroom project. The overarching goal was to seamlessly integrate this server with a forthcoming front-end application that would initiate requests to harness the server's capabilities.

Functioning as a real-time weather oracle, our server employs a weather API to extract pertinent weather-related data based on user-input locations. Users, in turn, are afforded the ability to not only retrieve current weather information but also to persistently track changes over time. A distinctive feature empowers users to save current weather details to a text file, fostering a continual weather observation experience.

This project extends beyond its practical utility; it serves as a potent tool for weather enthusiasts and researchers seeking to analyze and comprehend the nuanced trends in a location's atmospheric conditions.

This project uses prominent design patterns such as Strategy, Prototype, Iterator, State, Factory, Chain of Responsibility, Observer, and MVC. These design patterns imbue the application with a high degree of flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

Ensuring the robustness of our creation, we integrated proper validation and logging mechanisms, offering a seamless and error-resilient user experience. Our commitment to clarity and documentation is reflected in the comprehensive JavaDocs, facilitating a smooth understanding of the codebase.

To orchestrate the project's dependencies, we leveraged Maven as our build script, streamlining the management of libraries and external components. Additionally, the inclusion of UML designs for all implemented design patterns provides a visual roadmap for developers and stakeholders alike.

In essence, our collaborative effort in constructing this weather server is not just a coding endeavor; it's a testament to our commitment to best practices, design excellence, and the synthesis of technology and meteorological curiosity. Thank you, enjoy!
